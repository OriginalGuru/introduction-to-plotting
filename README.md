# introduction-to-plotting

## Learning Objectives

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks designed to improve your understanding of creating and customizing visualizations using Matplotlib and related tools.

### 1. Plotting with Matplotlib
In this notebook, you will learn how to:
- Build a **reusable plotting function** for creating custom line plots.
- Customize line styles, labels, axis limits, and subplots for multiple datasets.

### 2. Contour Plots with Matplotlib
In this notebook, you will learn how to:
- Create **contour plots** to visualize 3D data in 2D space.
- Use **filled contours** with `plt.contourf()` and **labeled contours** with `plt.contour()` and `plt.clabel()`.
- Customize plot properties, such as colormaps, axis labels, gridlines, and color bars.
- Build **reusable plotting functions** to streamline your workflow.

### 3. Interactive Plots with Ipywidgets
In this notebook, you will learn how to:
- Use **`ipywidgets`** to create **dynamic visualizations** that allow user interaction.
- Dynamically customize filled contour plots based on user input.
- Visualize and manipulate a mathematical function:
  \[
  $f(q_1, q_2) = k_1 \cdot q_1^2 + k_2 \cdot q_2^2 + c \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2$
  \]
- Adjust plot parameters like contour range and number of contours in real-time.
